# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Fluid Simulation with WebGL

I made this to try to learn something about interactive web development. This was primarily tested on Google Chrome; to increase performance on other browsers or older mobile devices, decrease the number of particles and/or set the rest density to zero. If performance is bad or the fluid behavior is super crazy, update Chrome -- I've noticed sometimes Chrome updates can cause performance issues which subsequent updates fix.

Responds to mouse movement on desktop, and touch input on mobile:
